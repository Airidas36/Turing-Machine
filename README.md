# Turing-Machine
Program simulates a turing machine, or can run 
multiple of them at the same time by using threads.
Text files contain data, states and instructions.
Halting state is defined by 'halt', although you are
not obliged to structure instructions like that.
The program is made to identify halting state by checking 
for a jump to a non-existant state.
